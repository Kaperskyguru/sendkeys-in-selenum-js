# SendKeys in Selenium JavaScript: A Complete Tutorial

## What is Selenium?

Selenium is a popular automation testing framework that allows you to interact with web applications. One of the most essential methods in Selenium is the sendKeys() method. The sendKeys() method allows you to enter text into a web element, such as a text or password field.

This method enables automated typing and data input into web elements, mimicking real user interactions with a web page.

In one product we were building in my company, we wanted to implement and run automated testing on all the features and services of this product to ensure it aligned with the requirements and conformed to users' needs.

So, we implemented this using Selenium. Everything works according to plan except where we want to input data or information like username and password to be processed by our test server.

This exact challenge we had is what sendKeys solves in Selenium when implementing automated testing or web scraping.

## What is the sendKeys() method?

In Selenium WebDriver using JavaScript, the sendKeys() method simulates keyboard input on a specific web element. This method is part of the WebElement interface and allows you to interact with input fields, text areas, and other elements that accept user input on a web page.

The sendKeys() method sends a series of keystrokes to the selected web element, effectively inputting the specified text or key combinations. It is handy for automating form filling, triggering events, or interacting with elements that require user input.

In our case above, we used Selenium's sendKeys() method to simulate our keyboard input on our username and password fields. Here's an example of how we use the sendKeys() method in our JavaScript project with Selenium WebDriver:

```js
// Assuming you have already set up the WebDriver and navigated to a web page\
// and located the text field with an ID "username"

const { Builder, By } = require("selenium-webdriver");

// Create a new WebDriver instance (for example, using Chrome)\
const driver = new Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();

// Navigate to a web page\
driver.get("<https://www.example.com>");

// Locate the text field\
const text_field = driver.findElement(By.id("username"));

// Input text into the text field using sendKeys()\
text_field.sendKeys("JohnDoe");
```

It looks quite simple. Well, it is not complicated, but this simple line of code allows you to input data into any text field in your project, including textarea, input and password field, etc.

The sendKeys() is not the only way to input data to text fields when implementing automated testing; there are other methods. However, let's explore the importance of using sendKeys() first.

## Examples of sendKeys() in Selenium JavaScript

Let's go through some examples of using sendKeys() in Selenium JavaScript to understand how this powerful method can be utilized for web automation and testing. Each example will demonstrate a specific use case, showcasing how to interact with different web elements using sendKeys().
